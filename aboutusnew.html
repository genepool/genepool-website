		<h1 class="genepool">About GenePool</h1>
		<p class="genepool">
			GenePool is a website that was conceived by a team of four high school students at the end of a 
			seven-week intensive <br> coding program powered by Girls Who Code.  Girls Who Code is an organization 
			trying to close the gender gap in the tech <br>industry.</p>
		
		<p class="genepool">	Our website was made with the goals of 
			identifying illnesses for which individuals would be at risk based on their genetic <br>makeup as 
			well as their location. With GenePool, we hope to identify and prevent any possible illnesses 
			in its first stages,<br> or even before its appearance.</p>
			
		<p class="genepool">	In the future, we hope GenePool will be able to 
			take in family medical history as another factor, and create an easy, <br>personalized experience. 
			Through this, you’ll be able to identify genetic diseases for which you are at risk, as well as 
			<br>any other members of your family. </p>
